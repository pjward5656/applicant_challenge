# SUDORS Epidemiologist Candidate Challenge

To complete this challenge, download the `applicant_data.csv` file from this repository. Complete the below three tasks utilizing a programming environment (such as SAS or R). Once you have completed the tasks, submit your code--only your code--in an email to patrickjward@uky.edu. 

This data contains 10 observations, each with a unique identifier, `id`. The variables `v1, v2, v3, v4, v5` are strings with names of animals. A value of `NA` indicates a value that is missing.

## Question 1

Transpose the data in variables `v1, v2, v3, v4, v5` from wide to long format.

## Question 2

Count the number of IDs that have "donkey", the number of IDs that have "zebra", and the number of IDs that have "horse" in any of `v1, v2, v3, v4, v5`. You should have separate counts for "donkey", "horse" and "zebra".

## Question 3

Visualize the frequencies of "donkey", "horse", and "zebra" that you calculated in the last question.
