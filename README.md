Transpose the data in variables `v1, v2, v3, v4, v5` from wide to long format.

## Question 2

Count the number of IDs that have "donkey", the number of observations that have "zebra", and the number of observations that have "horse" in any of `v1, v2, v3, v4, v5`. You should have separate counts for "donkey", "horse" and "zebra".

## Question 3

Visualize the frequencies of "donkey", "horse", and "zebra" that you calculated in the last question.
